/* Business Requirement: Â®
Objective: Analyze customer rental patterns to identify different behavioral segments

Specific Requirements:
Find each customer's total rentals and total spending
Calculate their average days between rentals (engagement frequency)
Identify their most rented film category
Flag if they've rented in the last 30 days (active status)

Segment customers into:
Customers who rent frequently AND spend a lot (top 25% in both metrics) 
Customers who rent frequently but don't spend much (top 25% rentals, but lower spending)
Customers who don't rent often but spend a lot when they do (lower rentals, but top 25% spending)
Everyone else: Customers who rent infrequently AND don't spend much*/
