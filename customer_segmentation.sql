/*Business Requirement: Customer Segmentation Analysis
Objective: Create a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis that classifies
customers into tiers based on their rental behavior, spending patterns, and engagement levels.

Requirements:
    Platinum: Top 10% by spending AND Top 50% by rental frequency
    Gold: Top 10% by spending OR Top 50% by rental frequency (but not both)
    Silver: Between 40th-60th percentile for both metrics  
    Bronze: Bottom 10% by spending AND Bottom 50% by rental frequency

    For each segment, calculate:
        Number of customers, Average total spending, Average rental frequency, 
        Average days between rentals (engagement frequency),Percentage of late returns,
        Identify which segments have the highest customer retention (customers who rented in the last 30 days),
        Show the revenue contribution percentage of each segment, Most popular category in that segment.
Expected Output Columns:
    customer_segment, customer_count, avg_total_spent, avg_rental_count, top_category, late_return_rate, avg_days_between_rentals, 
    segment_revenue_share, active_customer_percentage */
